<h1 id="top" align="center"> Interactive Applied Football Analytics using Clojure and Datomic </h1>
<h3 align="center"> A fully project based course that will educate you in topics such as math, football analytics, critical thinking, programming, immutable database, PLOP and much much more. Created by <a href="https://twitter.com/vishalgautamm">Vishal Gautam</a></h3>  


We are going to choose Clojure

Why?

- data driven programming language
- small core
- immutable data structures
- multicore programming
- hosted - leverage existing ecosystems
- nREPL facilitates Interactive Development Experience
- Solves many "Incidental Complexities" that are found in other programming language - TODO: elabobrate more

## Tools:
- Clojure
- Datomic
