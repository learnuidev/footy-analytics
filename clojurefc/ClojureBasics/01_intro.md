# Clojure Basics with Clojure FC


Clojure FC aim to make the basics of learning Clojure accessible to those that wish to learn, but may not have the advantage of access to paid resources or a background in maths of programming.

We recommend that you get Clojure installed with the instructions [here](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started), then follow along with our basics series listed below. The examples within certainly aren’t exhaustive, but they will give you an accessible introduction into the basic concepts with easy-to-follow examples based (sometimes tenuously!) on topics around football.

Once you have a grasp of the concepts above, you should aim to move on to our introduction to data analysis in Clojure. Here, you’ll learn about cleaning and analysing data in Clojure, as well as visualisation of your insights.
