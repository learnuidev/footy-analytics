# Clojure Basics with FC Python


Clojure FC aim to make the basics of learning Clojure accessible to those that wish to learn, but may not have the advantage of access to paid resources or a background in maths of programming.

We recommend that you get Clojure installed with the instructions [here](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started), then follow along with our basics series listed below. The examples within certainly arenâ€™t exhaustive, but they will give you an accessible introduction into the basic concepts with easy-to-follow examples based (sometimes tenuously!) on topics around football.
