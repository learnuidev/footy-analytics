# Learn Clojure & Data Science With Football

Clojure FC is a project that aims to put accessible resources for learning basic Clojure, programming & data skills in the hands of people interested in sport. Whether you are a Sports Science student, a coach, or anyone with a passing interest in football â€“ the tools shown across these pages will help you to get started with programming and using data with Clojure.

So many freely available resources are informative and comprehensive, but often too dry for people looking to get to grips with the first steps of programming. Subsequently, too many people miss out on picking up employable and useful skills in programming and data science. We hope to help this through delivering Clojure skills and tools with football data and concepts.
